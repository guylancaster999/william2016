					Pianist  William Cuthbertson, who was born and brought up in England, has lived in Waldkirch, Baden Wurtenburg, in Germany&rsquo;s Black Forest, for many years. 
					He plays  an active part in local cultural activities, both as performer and organiser.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					As a child, Cuthbertson won many musical prizes in his home county of Kent as a pupil of Bernard King at Sevenoaks School. 
					He studied piano at the <a href="http://www.ram.ac.uk/" title="Royal Academy of Music">Royal Academy of Music</a> in London with Ruth Harte and Gordon Green. 
					He then continued his studies in Krakow, Poland on a Polish Government scholarship, studying with Ludwik Stefanski, and has continued to specialise in playing the works of Chopin.
					<br/>

					The Badische Zeitung (4/03/2010 ) wrote:
					<blockquote><em>&quot;Cuthbertson's  playing attests to the highest technical skill and virtuosic brilliance and  his interpretation is thereby absolutely free and rich in nuances. 
					A mastery of  musical expression, which is probably only possible through a lifelong preoccupation with Chopin.
					His stupendous  technique allows him to conquer technical hurdles with casual elegance&quot;</em> 
					(Fränkische Landeszeitung ).&rdquo;</blockquote>
					Cuthbertson is also co-organiser of <a href="http://kulturwoche-waldkirch.de/">Waldkircher Kulturwochen (Arts  Festival) </a> and is a founding member of the local Community Cinema,  where he regularly accompanies silent films with free improvisation, and the <a href="http://www.klappe11.de/">Klappe 11</a> festival.
