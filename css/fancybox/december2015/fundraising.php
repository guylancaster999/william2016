<h3>How can you help? </h3>
<br/> 
TVS relies heavily on: 
<ul>
<li> <strong>Subscriptions/standing orders from regular supporters </strong></li>
<li> <strong>one-off donations </strong></li>
<li>  <strong>Gift Aid </strong></li>
</ul>  
You can:
<ul>
<li>Make a <strong>donation </strong>to TVS through <a href="https://mydonate.bt.com/charities/tyumevalleyschools">BT MyDonate</a>.. </li>
<li>Become a<strong> regular subscriber</strong>.  Supporting TVS as a regular donor is the   best way to help us achieve our long-term goals. Even a small monthly   donation of Â£5 can make a huge difference over the longer-term. Click <a href="doc/Gift-Aid-Form.docx">here</a> to download a Standing Order and Gift Aid Form. </li>
<li>Organise a<strong> fundraising event</strong> such as a car boot sale or concert. </li>
<li>Take part in a <strong>sponsored walk/run/cycle ride</strong> to raise money for TVS. </li>
<li>Leave a gift in your will. Even a very small percentage of your estate could make a real difference to TVS. Your solicitor or other professional adviser will help you with the wording, but here are examples of wording you might use:
	<ul class="ulsqr">
	<li class="ulsqr"> Residuary gift: 'I give all (or a...% share of) the residue of my estate to Tyume Valley Schools, 2 Old Blackfriars, Marley Lane, Battle, East Sussex TN33 0DQ, Registered Charity 1103909, to be used for its general charitable purposes and I declare that the receipt of their Treasurer or other proper officer shall be a full and sufficient discharge.'
	</li>
	<li class="ulsqr">Pecuniary gift: 'I give the sum of &pound; (words &amp; figures) to Tyume Valley Schools, 2 Old Blackfriars, Marley Lane, Battle, East Sussex, TN33 0DQ Registered Charity 1103909, to be used for its general charitable purposes and I declare that the receipt of their Treasurer or other proper officer shall be a full and sufficient discharge.' </li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul class="ulsqr">
	<li  class="ulsqr"> Karen Barker, from Good Shepherd Runners, will be   running the 2015 London Marathon in aid of TVS. Karen says:  
		<blockquote>&ldquo;I am very honoured to have the opportunity to run the Marathon for TVS. 
        I am excited but also pretty nervous!! 
        I love running but haven't run more than a half marathon yet... 
        My goal over the next couple of months is to increase my distance so I feel OK to run 16+ miles, then in the new   year I plan to build on that.  
        I am very impressed with the things that TVS have achieved. Knowing the great educational opportunities that my children have had (and myself in the past), I think it is fantastic to help those who are less fortunate in that respect.&rdquo;
