The Badische Zeitung (4/03/2010 ) wrote:
<blockquote><em>&quot;Cuthbertson's  playing attests to the highest technical skill and virtuosic brilliance  and  his interpretation is thereby  absolutely free and rich in nuances. 
A mastery of  musical expression, which is probably only possible through a lifelong preoccupation with Chopin.
His stupendous  technique allows him to conquer technical hurdles with casual elegance&quot;</em> 
(Fränkische Landeszeitung ).&rdquo;</blockquote>
Cuthbertson is also co-organiser of <a href="http://kulturwoche-waldkirch.de/">Waldkircher Kulturwochen (Arts  Festival) </a> and is a founding member of the local Community Cinema,  where he regularly accompanies silent films with free improvisation, and the <a href="http://www.klappe11.de/">Klappe 11</a> festival.
